{"name":"Pub","tagline":"PUB! is a Programmable USB Button on which you can record a sequence of keystrokes (and/or other USB functions) and then play that sequence back when you press it.","body":"PUB! Programmable USB Button\r\n============================\r\nProgram a button to send keystrokes to your computer\r\n\r\n\r\nPUB! is a Programmable USB Button on which you can program a sequence of keystrokes. When you press the button those keystrokes are \"replayed\" over a USB connection.\r\n\r\nThe button (really a rotary encoder with a built-in push button switch) is programmed using an innovative and slightly quirky interface that does not require any custom software to be installed on your computer. All you need is a text editor like Notepad or gedit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n- One-button design (a rotary encoder with a built in switch).\r\n- Programmed by using an ordinary text editor as a display (for example, gedit on Linux, or Notepad on Windows).\r\n- Up to 127 keystrokes can be recorded and played back.\r\n- Support for conditional logic. For example, Compare to value, Jump on zero, etc.\r\n- Support for 256 x 8-bit \"registers\" to record state.\r\n- Support for basic arithmetic. Add, subtract, etc.\r\n- Can send USB System Control codes (Power off, sleep, wake) to your PC\r\n- Can send USB Consumer Device functions (e.g. Mute, Play, Pause, Stop, etc.)\r\n- Requires NO drivers (or custom software) for Windows/Linux etc\r\n\r\n\r\nFutures\r\n-------\r\nThe possibilities are fairly broad including:\r\n- Using a Bluetooth module to detect proximity of the button owner's mobile phone so that the USB button is only enabled when its owner is near.\r\n- Addition of an external EEPROM for extra keystroke capacity.\r\n- The one-button user interface will be improved to make it easier to use.\r\n\r\nConstruction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSee http://www.instructables.com/id/PUB-Programmable-USB-Button/\r\n\r\nHow To Use\r\n----------\r\n### You want to program your password onto the PUB! button\r\n  - Open a text editing program (for example, gedit or Notepad) and make sure it has keyboard focus\r\n  - Plug PUB! into a host USB port\r\n  - By default it is in RUN mode, so press and hold the rotary encoder knob for more than 1 second to switch to PROGRAM mode. It will display in your text editor:\r\n\r\n          PUB!
